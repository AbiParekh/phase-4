/// Questions for the Professor: 
///		1. Is the program only supposed to accept files with a text file (.txt) extension? Assume it in text file 
///		2. Is the program going to have all files are at the top level of the input directory or are we supposed to go lower down? Top Level   
///		3. Does Punctuation include the following: ('.', '!', '?', ',', ':', ';', '-', '[', ']', '{', '}', '(', ')', ''', ' ` ', '"', '...'
///		4. How should we handle the following? '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '_', '+', '=', '\', '<', '>', '/', '~'? Should we Treat them as Chars?
///     5. Does the output have to be?  (“a”, 1), (“the”, 1), (“is”, 1), (“the”, 1), (“a”, 1)' with all one line.
